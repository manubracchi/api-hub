# API Hub ðŸ”‘

The console is dependent on many APIs, and since we can't store all those secrets securely on the client, we'll use a "parent" API that makes requests to other APIs using their corresponding secrets and validating the token provided by Auth0 or Firebase Auth

## How it works ðŸ¤”
- The frontend API does a request, in this request is specified the name of the api, and the path to work on. (e.g. http://localhost:8080/open-weather/data/2.5/onecall?lat=1&lon=1 ).
- The first part of the path is the api name ( open-weather ) and the rest is the api path to request.
- The backend ( this app ) validates the auth token provided by Auth0 and also limits the rate of requests to prevent abuse even for logged users.
- Then does a identical request BUT including the API key ( in the URL or in the headers ), body and all the other headers that aren't auth are sent as they are.
- The request response is sent to the frontend.

## How to configure it
You can add all APIs you want to the *apis.json* file respecting the following pattern
```jsx
{
  "open-weather": {                           // API name
    "type": "query",                          // Type of the 
    "meta": "appid",                          // API key param / header name
    "secret": "OWEATHER_KEY",                 // Name of the env variable containing the secret
    "url": "https://api.openweathermap.org/", // URL of the API
    "allowed-methods": ["GET", "POST"],       // Allowed methods ( blank is all )
  }
}
```

## Local setup
```bash
yarn # or npm i

# Dev mode with logs and .env file
yarn dev # or npm run dev

# Normal mode
yarn start # or npm start
```


## Docker setup
```bash
# Create a docker container
docker build youruser/api-hub .

# Run the created container
docker run -p 8080:8080 youruser/api-hub
```
